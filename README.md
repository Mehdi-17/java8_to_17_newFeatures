# Java 8 to Java 17 learning resource

This repository is a personal learning resource for me, covering the evolution of the Java language from version 8 to the latest Java 17. Explore new features, enhancements, and best practices, while I gain valuable insights into modern Java development.

From the readme, you can explore the evolution of the Java language from version 8 to the latest Java 17.  
Below, you'll find links to various Java features and enhancements:

## New Switch syntax
 Java 12 introduced a new syntax for the switch statement, making it more concise and easier to read.

## New Pattern Matching for the instanceof operator
Java 14 introduced a new enhancement called "Pattern Matching for the instanceof operator" which simplifies the code when working with object types.  
With the new syntax, you can create a variable within the if statement to increase readability :

## Type Inference
Java introduced type inference since Java 10. They add the 'var' word (not a key word for backward compatibility) to initialize a variable.  
Type inference doesn't work for class fields.
